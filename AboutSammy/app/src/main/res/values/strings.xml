\n zeros are padded prior to the integer 123 in the second line of the output.
\n For the floating-point variable, flt_num, line 13 prints out the floating-point value in the
\n default format, and line 14 reduces the decimal places to two by putting the precision
\n specifier .2 within the format specifier %-10.2f. Note here that left-justification is also
\n specified by the minus sign (-) in the floating-point format specifier.
